# Web access to knitted HTML output

We have decided to take a leap and try plot_ly and knit to html output for this milestone.
The html page is hosted as [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is accessible
in this address:
++TBD++ [https://tin6150.github.io/phw251_group_z/milestone5_groupZ.html](https://tin6150.github.io/phw251_group_z/milestone5_groupZ.html)


This is intended as final end user report, 
code blocks have been omitted for brevity, but it is available at

# Final Report


## Problem Statement (1-2 paragraphs)


++ Aubrey  will write this?

## Methods, for each data source

Source
Years and/or dates of data
Description of cleaning and creating new variables
Analytic methods

++ please review that they make sense, and that i didn't omit anything and met the rubric requirements ++

We used 3 datasets for this project:

 * CA demographics 
 * CA mortality surveillance
 * HCAI healthcare construction funding
 
The first dataset is from the 2012 Census and contains demographics info for each of the 58 counties of California.  It includes info such as population per square mile, median age, number of households who are renters vs owners, ethnicity, genres, etc.   We calculated renter to owner ratio for each county.  Then calculated average age and population density for the whole state and visually inspected the data to see how each county stack up.  We ended up using the National Rural Development Partnershipâ€™s definition to determine if a given county's population density is to be classified as rural, for which there were 11.  

The second dataset is the mortality surveillance obtained from the CA Open Data Portal.  It contains a breakdown of total mortality for each county by 15 disease areas.  We used the CDC definition to filter for the chronic diseases, for which 10 fit in this criteria.  The data range from 2014 to 2020, but we were tasked to focus on the last 5 years, thus we applied a filter with Year >= 2016.  As tasked, we also performed filters with Geography_Type == "Occurrence"  and used Strata == "Total Population" to avoid overcounting.  Any missing data were replaced with 0.  Once the data is cleaned, we summed all the disease occurrences within each county.  We joined this with the demographics data to obtain a mortality rate of chronic conditions over 5 years for each county.

The third dataset is the HCAI funding, also obtained from the CA Open Data Portal.  It contains healthcare spending for each county in 4 stages of project progression, updated about every 2 weeks.  We focused on the latest available data, which was Aug 11, 2022, and those with state of "In Closure".  Many rural counties showed up with $0 amount, and we went back to double check our selection code.  It checked out, much fundings are in large populous counties such as LA and Alameda.  It was not that rural counties had no funding, there were fundings for example in the "In Construction" phase, but we decided to focus on "In Closure" to help our improvement plan to drive new spending for rural counties with high and variable mortality rates.

After cleaning and filtering the 3 dataset above, we joined them by county name, whereby we can see which counties has high renters, high chronic mortality rates, and the funding they receive.  

## Results 

++ please improve on this ++


(should this go here?  or in Discussion?)
We tried to see if there were any counties that satisfy all 3 criterias of:

 * Rural by National Rural Development Parthnership's definition.
 * High rental rate (higher than state-wide average)
 * High median age (higher than state-wide average)

But this resulted in 0 county.  As such, our selection criteria were relaxed the selection by removing the 

  rental rate > state average.

From this, we got a list with 8 counties.  We ranked these by renter:owner ratio, and obtained our list of 5 counties to focus: Inyo, Siskiyou, Mariposa, Modoc and Plumas.

When we plotted Mortality Rate for each of the 11 rural counties, we see what our 5 counties selection have the highest rate.  

++ please expand ++

we observe that this list of 8 counties, all had a zero dollar amount for the HCAI funding at the "In Closure" state.

Below ... 

++ please expand ++



## Rural Counties Deserving More HCAI Funding


++ TIN FIX TBD ... i changed it a bit here from Milestone 4, now show 8 counties, 
will find way to highlight them or something ++

Table 1 shows that the 5 counties we selected as deserving more HCAI funding.  
They are the counties of Siskiyou, Inyo, Mariposa, Plumas and Modoc.
All these 5 counties have low population density (they qualify as Rural per National Rural Development Partnership's definition), 
have a high median age, and fairly high ratio of renters.
More importantly, they have one of the highest percentage of chronic diseases mortality,
and no HCAI fundings that are "In Closure" as of 2022-08-11.

As background reference, across all 58 CA counties, we found these statistics:

 * average population density: 665 person per square mile.
 * average rent:own ratio is: 64.7%
 * average age is: 38.5

Note that mortality rate is calculated based on the latest available  population data: 2012.

## Mortality Rate by County

Below is a graph of Mortality Rate for Chronic diseases (as defined by CDC)
across 11 rural counties (as defined by National Rural Development Partnership)
The 5 counties of focus have the highest mortality rates in this group.

Note that we don't have disease data for Alpine or Sierra county.  

```{r viz: chronic mortality rates by counties, echo=F, include=T}

chronic_focus_counties = inner_join(
    demographics_chronic,
    rural_counties,
    by = "County"                   ) %>%
  mutate( ctyColor = case_when(
    County == "Siskiyou" ~ "red", 
    County == "Inyo"     ~ "darkorange" , 
    County == "Mariposa" ~ "blue", 
    County == "Plumas"   ~ "darkblue",
    County == "Modoc"    ~ "darkcyan",
    TRUE                 ~ "rgb(187, 216, 228)"
  ) )


fig3 = plot_ly( data = chronic_focus_counties ) %>%
    add_trace(
            x = ~County,
            y = ~pct,
            name = 'Chronic Mortality Rates by Counties',
            marker = list(color = ~ctyColor),
            hoverinfo = "text",
            text = ~paste(round(pct, 1), "%" ),  
            type = 'bar') %>%
   layout(
            title = "Chronic Mortality Rates For California's Rural Counties", 
            yaxis = list( title="% Mortality Rate"),
            xaxis = list( title="County", categoryorder='total descending' )

## Chronic disease mortality rates vs HCAI funding

The following boxplot summarizes chronic disease mortality rates from all 
CA counties, grouped according to HCAI funding amounts for in closure projects 
as of August 2022. The funding amounts were categorized as "high" if they were 
above the mean amount, low if they were below the mean, and "no funding" if no 
funding for in closure projects was reported. 
 
(Please describe how this graph help with our narrative on the 5 counties selected)

```{r, echo=F, include=T}

funding_chronic <- funding_data %>% 
  filter( `OSHPD Project Status` == "In Closure") %>%
  filter( `Data Generation Date` == as_date( "2022-08-11")) %>%
  mutate(funding_amount = case_when(
    Numeric_Cost > 12239849 ~ "High Funding", 
    Numeric_Cost == 0 ~ "No Funding", 
    Numeric_Cost < 12239849 ~ "Low Funding"
  )) %>%
  inner_join(demographics_chronic, funding_data_all_counties, by = "County") %>%
  select(pct, County, funding_amount, rural_class, Numeric_Cost)

plot_ly(
  funding_chronic,
  y=~pct,
  color= ~funding_amount,
  type="box"
) %>%
   layout(
    title="Chronic Disease Mortality Rates & HCAI Funding",
    yaxis=list(title="Chronic Disease Rate"))
```

## Table showing most common disease by rural county

This table shows the most common chronic disease in each of the rural counties, while also showing the number of people who have the illness in the year 2020. The counties of Alpine and Sierra did not have chronic disease data available.  As we expand funding in the 5 select counties of focus, special emphasis should be placed on Heart Disease, as that's the most common chronic illness causing high mortality.
*HTD= Heart Disease, CAN= Cancer

```{r, echo=F, include=T}
table_data_e<- inner_join(rural_not_rural, chronic_mortality_data, by= "County") %>% 
select(c("County", "rural_class", "Cause","Count", "Year")) %>% filter(Year%in%2020) %>% 
filter(rural_class=="rural") %>% 
group_by(County,Cause) %>% summarize(count_cause=sum(Count)) %>% arrange(County,desc(c(count_cause))) %>% slice(c(1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101))

table_data_e[1,2]<-"Not Available"
table_data_e[9,2]<-"Not Available"

common_chronic<- kable(table_data_e, col.names=c("County", "Chronic Disease", "Number Reported"),
digits=0, booktabs=T, escape=F, align="ccc", caption="Most Common Chronic Disease by Rural County in 2020")
common_chronic
```

This maybe useful, was left out in Milestone 4.

```{r viz: funding for select counties, include=F, echo=T }

# Visuals saved for possible use in Milestone 5 

# Funding for select counties


counties_funding_comp = funding_data %>%
