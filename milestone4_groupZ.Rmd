# Web Access to knitted HTML output

We have decided to take a leap and try plot_ly and knit to html output for this milestone.
The html page is hosted as [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is accessible
in this address:

# Visualizations & Code

Data needed to make decision:
-which counties share all 3 attributes: low pop(rural), high median age, 
& high proportion of renters vs homeowners
-which 5 counties have highest mortality rates due to chronic illness
-what counties have received little to no funding recently? ---not quite sure 
about this one

# Rural Counties Deserving More HCAI Funding

Table 1 shows that the 5 counties of Siskiyou, Inyo, Mariposa, Plumas and Modoc
have low population density (they qualify as Rural per National Rural Development Partnership's definition), 
have a high median age, and fairly high ratio of renters.
More importantly, they have one of the highest percentage of chronic diseases,
and no HCAI fundings that are "In Closure" as of 2022-08-11.

Note that the latest population data is from 2012.

The following boxplot summarizes chronic disease mortality rates from all

as of August 2022. The funding amounts were categorized as "high" if they were 
above the mean amount, low if they were below the mean, and "no funding" if no 
funding for in closure projects was reported.
